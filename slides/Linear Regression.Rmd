Basic linear models aim to describe a linear relationship between a:

- response (dependent) variable and a predictor (independent) variable. 

--

- usually by the method of ordinary least squares.

## Straight line equation

$$
\LARGE{y = a + bx}
$$

.left-code[

### Where:

$y$ is the predicted value of the response variable



$a$ is the intercept (value of y when x = 0)



$b$ is the slope of the regression line



$x$ is the value of the explanatory variable

## Line of best fit

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.alt = "Line fitting"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/fit-linear.png")

```

---
class: center, middle

The line of best fit minimises the sum of the **squared distance** that *each* sample point is from the value predicted by the model

This is called the method of

##Ordinary Least Squares

---

## Residuals

--

The difference between the ACTUAL value of the observation $y_i$ and the value that the model predicts $\hat{y_i}$ at that $x$ value are the residuals (residual error).

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "residuals"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/ols.png")

```

The regression model fitted by **O**rdinary **L**east **S**quares (OLS) will produce the equation for the line that **MINIMIZES** the sum of squares of the residuals

---


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.alt = "sum of squares error"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/ols-2.png")

```


This produces the line with the *smallest* total area size for the squares. 

$$
SSE = \underset{i=1}{n \atop{\sum}}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
$$
--

SUM OF RESIDUAL ERROR = $(2)+(-1)+(4)+(-3)+(-2)=0$

SUM OF SQUARES OF RESIDUAL ERROR = $(2^2)+(-1^2)+(4^2)+(-3^2)+(-2^2)=34$

.left-code[

**SST** The squared differences between the observed dependent variable ($y_i$) and its overall mean ($\overline{y}$).

**SSR** The sum of the differences between the predicted value ($\hat{y_i}$) of the dependent variable and its overall mean ($\overline{y}$).

**SSE** The error is the difference between the observed dependent value ($y_i$)  and the predicted value ($\hat{y_i}$).

## Linear model equation

$$
\LARGE{y_i = a + bx+\epsilon}
$$

$y_i$ is the predicted value of the response variable

$a$ is the intercept (value of y when x = 0)

$b$ is the slope of the regression line

$x$ is the value of the explanatory variable

$\epsilon$ is the value of the residual error

## Coefficient of determination


$\LARGE{R^2}$ : The proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variable

--

$$
\LARGE{R^2=1-{Sum~of~Squared~Distances~between~y_i~and~\hat{y_i}\over{Sum~of~Squared~Distances~between~y_i~and~\overline{y}}} }
$$

--

$$
\LARGE{R^2=1-{SSE\over{SST}}}
$$

---

## Adjusted $\LARGE{R^2}$

Adjusted $R^2$ is a corrected goodness-of-fit measure for linear models.

--

$R^2$ always increases as the number of effects are included in the model. Good for overall prediction, but does not check efficiency. 

--

Adjusted $R^2$ can fall if a model term does not *improve* the fit of the model

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/adj_r.png")

$N$ = numerator degrees of freedom = Total number of observations across all groups

$k$ = Total number of groups

$N-k$ = denominator degrees of freedom

 **I** fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict **timber hardness from wood density**. The model explains a statistically significant and substantial proportion of variance (R^2 = 0.95, F~1~34~) = 636.98, p < .001, adj. R2 = 0.95). The model shows that for each unit increase in wood density (kg/m^3) there is an **increase** of 57.51 (lbf) on the Janka wood hardness scale (Beta = 57.51, 95% CI [52.88, 62.14], t(34) = 25.24, p < .001). Model residuals were checked against the assumptions of a standard linear model.
