## Butterfly and temperature effects

- Analysis of museum specimens of a univoltine butterfly species

- Does average temperature and rainfall effect body size?

- Do males and females respond differently to environmental conditions?

## Understanding data

We have to really understand our data to be able to decide on the appropriate analyses to answer our research questions. It can also lead to unexpected & interesting research questions. That requires first **looking** at your data, usually in a number of ways, to ask questions like: 

- Are there interesting patterns, groups, trends or relationships?

- How are observations distributed?

- Are there outliers?

- Is there notable bias in observations or missing observations?

### Always start a data analysis by thinking about it really hard before analyzing

--

## EVERY TIME

---

## Understand your data

- Is each column in the appropriate data type? Factor, character, dbl, integer?

- Are the columns and names easy to use/understand?

- Basic data cleaning/ tidy data formatting

---

## Data import

We should check all of our column names

```{r}
colnames(butterfly_df)

```

And if needed put them in a consistent naming style

```{r}
butterfly_df <- janitor::clean_names(butterfly_df)
colnames(butterfly_df)
```

---

## Basic information

What do we need to know about our data?

```{r, eval = F}
nrow(butterfly_df)
# number of rows of dataframe

str(butterfly_df)

summary(butterfly_df)
```



---

class: center, middle, inverse

## Univariate analysis


---

## Univariate analysis

Continuous variables:

Understand skew, outliers

Factorial variables:

Relative abundances, number of categories

All: 

Missing values

---

## Univariate analysis

This variable has one clear data outlier - we will leave it for now - but understanding its presence is important

```{r}
hist(butterfly_df$rain_jun)
# outlier detected

butterfly_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rain_jun)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

---

```{r}
hist(butterfly_df$forewing_length)
# no outliers
```

---

```{r}
hist(butterfly_df$jun_mean)
# no outliers
```

---

## Checking for groups and typos

Understanding the number of levels in our factors (and whether there are mistakes) is important

```{r}
unique(butterfly_df$sex)
# typos detected
```


```{r}
butterfly_clean <- butterfly_df %>%
   mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "Female" ~ "Females",
                             sex == "Maes" ~ "Males",
                             .default = as.character(sex)))
unique(butterfly_clean$sex)

```

---

## How many males and females

Are our groups equally weighted (or near enough)

```{r}
butterfly_clean %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```


---

### Understand data

Understand missingness 

The amount and distribution of missing values could indicate bias in our data collection

```{r}
butterfly_clean %>%                                    # Count NA by group
  group_by(sex) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(na_sex = sum(is.na(sex)),
                   na_year = sum(is.na(year)),
                   na_forewing_length = sum(is.na(forewing_length)))

```

---

### Understand data

Understand missingness 

The amount and distribution of missing values could indicate bias in our data collection

```{r}
butterfly_clean %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))

```


---

class: split-four

### Understand data

## Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(butterfly_clean,
                aes(colour = sex))

```

---

## Scatter plots

Show values of observations within a group, adding some amount of “jitter” so that they don’t all overlap 

.left-code[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(butterfly_clean, aes(x = jun_mean,
                     y = forewing_length))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
              aes(colour = sex))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_light()
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(butterfly_clean, aes(x = jun_mean,
                     y = forewing_length))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
              aes(colour = sex))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_light()
```
]

---

## Scatter plots

.left-code[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(butterfly_clean, aes(x = rain_jun,
                     y = forewing_length))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
              aes(colour = sex))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_light()
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(butterfly_clean, aes(x = rain_jun,
                     y = forewing_length))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
              aes(colour = sex))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_light()
```
]


---

## Corrplot

.left-code[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(corrplot)

butterfly_clean %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
corrplot()

```

]

.right-plot[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

library(corrplot)

butterfly_clean %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
corrplot()

```

]

---

## Analysis

```{r}
model <- lm(forewing_length ~ jun_mean + sex + rain_jun + jun_mean:sex,
            data = butterfly_clean)

summary(model)
```

---

## Check model fit

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)
```

---

```{r, out.width = "70%"}
performance::check_model(model, detrend = F)
```
---

## Issues

.pull-left[


- multicollinearity

```{r}

vif(model)

```

]

.pull-right[

- outlier effect

```{r, out.width = "80%"}

plot(model, which = c(4,4))

```

]

---

## Mean-centering

This helps center the intercept at the average rain and temperature

It can also reduce or eliminate multicollinearity

```{r}

butterfly_clean <- butterfly_clean %>% 
  mutate(rain_jun_center = rain_jun - mean(rain_jun, na.rm = T),
         jun_mean_center = jun_mean - mean(jun_mean, na.rm = T))

```

---

## Outlier 

Unsurprisingly the row of data with exceptionally high recorded rainfall is our outlier. 

We will remove it from the data and refit the model. 

Not shown here but it is a good idea to compare the models and see how much the outlier(s) actually change model interpretations

```{r}

butterfly_clean[19,]

```

---

## Outlier

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

model2 <- lm(forewing_length ~ jun_mean_center + sex + rain_jun_center + jun_mean_center:sex,
            data = butterfly_clean[-19,])

plot(model2)


```


---

## Formal checks

- Formal checks can help support residual plot checking

- These test if deviations from assumptions are large enough to cause problems

```{r, eval = F}
# Breusch Pagan test for normality
lmtest::bptest(model2)
```


```{r, eval = F}
# qqplot with confidence intervals
car::qqPlot(model2) # adds a confidence interval check
```


```{r, eval = F}

# shapiro wilk test for homoscedasticity
shapiro.test(residuals(model2))

```



---

## Transformations

Our model was fine - but can it be improved?

```{r}
car::boxCox(model2)
# indicates a log transformation could be suitable?

```

---

## Room for improvement?

- The nearest straighforward transformation would be natural log:

```{r}
# Could also check if outlier is still an issue when dependent variable transformed?
model3 <- lm(log(forewing_length) ~ jun_mean_center + sex + rain_jun_center + jun_mean_center:sex,
             data = butterfly_clean[-19,])

```


---

## Room for improvement?

The exact maximum likelihood transformation can be taken from lambda: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
b <- car::boxCox(model2)
lambda <- b$x[which.max(b$y)]
lambda
```


```{r}

model4 <- lm(((forewing_length^lambda-1)/lambda) ~ jun_mean_center + sex + rain_jun_center + jun_mean_center:sex,
             data = butterfly_clean[-19,])


```

---

## Compare models

Although data transformations marginally improve the fit of the model, it probably isn't worth the added complexity. 

```{r}

summary(model2)$adj.r.squared
summary(model3)$adj.r.squared
summary(model4)$adj.r.squared

```

---

- With my chosen model, I can noe reliably test for statistical significance and effects

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width = "30%"}
# Test interactions

model2a <- lm(forewing_length ~ jun_mean_center + sex + rain_jun_center,
              data = butterfly_clean[-19,])

summary(model2a)

```

]

.pull-right[

*I tested for an interaction between sex and changing average temperature, but found no significant effect t<sub>52</sub> = 1.437, p = 0.16*

]

---

-  I tested for an interaction between sex and changing average temperature, but found no significant effect F<sub>1,53</sub> = 2.06,  p = 0.16

```{r}
drop1(model2, test = "F")
anova(model2a, model2)

```

---

## Insights

What interesting biological insights can I extract?

```{r}

confint(model2a)
broom::tidy(model2a, conf.int = T)

```

---

## Insights

> Under average conditions females had a mean forewing length (mm) of 11.2mm [95% CI, 9.5 - 12.9], while males were an average of 1.3mm[1.07 - 1.55] smaller.

> Every one degree celsius change in mean June temperature produced a 0.2mm [0.09 - 0.33] increase in body size.


Consider these effect sizes (and uncertainties) on the scale and range of the observed data. 

---

## Visualisation

- It's important to use the predictions built from *your* model. 

- `geom_smooth` produces *separate* regression fits for each line on the graph

- This is not going to be the same as your complex models

## What have I proved?

- There is evidence to support a positive effect of temperature on body size

- Female butterflies are larger than males

---

## What have I failed to show?

- Sex-specific effects of temperature on size - this may mean there is no such effect, or that we made a Type 2 error due to random sampling or sample size

- No effect of average rainfall on size - for the same reasons
