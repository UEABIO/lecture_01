## When to write a function

‚ÄúYou should consider writing a function whenever you‚Äôve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice‚Äù

 H. Wickham

---

## Functions in R

.left-code[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

function01 <- 
  function(argument1,
           argument2,
           ...){
    # body where you put in the functions
    # output
           }
```
]

.right-plot[

* `function01` name of function

* `function()` make a function, function!

* `argument1` placeholders for values that will be supplied to a finished argument

* body 
  * the code that solves your problem
  
* output
  * by default the last object made is returned
  * `return()` can be use to return other selected objects
]

---

## Why would I write a function?

.left-code[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# simple dataframe

df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df

```

]

.right-plot[

```{r, echo = FALSE}

df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df

```

]

---


$$
z_i = {x_i-min(x)\over{max(x)-min(x)}}
$$
.pull-left[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# What are we doing here?
df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))

df

```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# What are we doing here?
df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))

df

```

]


There is nothing wrong with this code, it works. 

BUT: My script will be longer, I might make mistakes, if I carryover mistakes I have to go looking for them

## Functionalise

```{r, eval = FALSE}

df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))

```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# pull out what's common, these are your arguments
x <- (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))

```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# can this be simplified more?
x <- (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# rewrite as a function

rescale <- function(x) {#<<
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

```

---

## Test it

```{r}
rescale <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}
testvec <- 1:11
testvec

```

```{r}
rescale(testvec)
```

**Q. Does the result make sense?**

---
## Put it to work

```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = rnorm(10), b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(10), d = rnorm(10))
rescale <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}
out <- df #make a copy so we don't have to remake df again
out$a <- rescale(df$a) # scale column a
out$b <- rescale(df$b) # scale column b
out$c <- rescale(df$c) # scale column c
out$d <- rescale(df$d) # scale column d
out # let's look

```

---

# Sensible errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
rescale <- function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("rescaling must be applied to a number")#<<
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}


vector <- c("a", "vector", "of", "characters")

rescale(vector)
```

---

## Function writing best practices

* Make sure it does what you want it to do

* Use good names

  * functions do stuff; use verbs
  * arguments are things; use nouns
  * don't overwrite existing functions
  
* Argument order matters

  * tidyverse assumes data input comes first
  * detail arguments come later (e.g. na.rm = TRUE)

* Make output clear and obvious

The Tidyverse style guide is here: http://style.tidyverse.org/

---


## Source scripts & functions

You may find it useful to assemble your custom functions into a dedicated R script.

This can then be sourced for use in any other R scripts when required

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("path/to/some/file/functions.R")
```

Simply add this line to the top of your R script and you‚Äôll be able to use any functions defined in file.R.

---

## Packages

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible code. When functions become routinely useful to you, you might consider turning them into a package for your personal R `library()` to be called at a moments notice. 

If your functions might be useful to others, it can be made public (via Github or CRAN), so that others can use it too. 

A reason to remember to always `cite` R packages

# Data structures

---
## Data structures

1. Vector

2. Matrix

3. List

4. Dataframe/tibble

---

## Vector

All elements are of the same type. 



```{r}
name <- c("MICHAEL", "LUCY", "JOHN")

age <- c(20,25,30)

```

--

R will routinely apply functions to all elements of a vector automatically

```{r}
str_remove(name, "L")

sum(age)

```


---

## Matrix

Matrix is a special kind of vector. 

A matrix is a vector with two additional attributes: the number of rows and the number of columns.

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, ncol=2)

x

```

```{r}

x[1,2]

```
---

##List

List can contain elements of different types.

```{r}
y <- list(name = name, age = age, work = c("Oxford", "Cambridge", "London"))
y
```

---

##List 

```{r}

y[1]

y$work[2]

```
---
##tibble

A tibble is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length.

Each vector can contain elements of different types



```{r}

df2 <- tibble(name, age, work = c("Oxford", "Cambridge", "London"))

df2

```
---

##tibble

With a tibble we can use all of the power of `dplyr` for data wrangling

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  select(name)

df2 %>% 
  filter(age < 26)

```

---

## So... what about those repeats? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
out <- df
out$a <- rescale(df$a)
out$b <- rescale(df$b)
out$c <- rescale(df$c)
out$d <- rescale(df$d)
out

```

The function simplified the call, but we're copying and pasting again.

ü§î


---
## Loops

```{r}

for (i in 1:ncol(df)) { # loop through each element
  out[i] <- rescale(df[[i]]) #apply function and store in out[]
}

out

```

---

##Apply

```{r}

sapply(df, rescale)

sapply(df, rescale) %>% 
  is.matrix(.)
```

---

##Apply

|Function|Arguments|Objective|Input|Output|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|apply|apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)|Apply a function to the rows, columns or both| Dataframe or matrix| vector, list or array|
|lapply| lapply(X,FUN)|Apply a function to all the elements of the input| List, vector or dataframe| list|
|sapply| sapply(X,FUN)| Apply a function to all the elements of the input| List, vector or dataframe| vector or matrix|

---

##Map

```{r}

map_df(.x = df, 
       .f = rescale) #map over the columns in df


```

---

map iterates over a list and returns a list

* .x list (or vector) to iterate over

* .f function to apply over that list

* ... things that get passed from map() to .f


```{r}

l <-  list(a=1:10, b = 10:100)

map(.x = l, 
    .f = function(x) {
      mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)})

# here I have used an anonymous function
```

The names .x and .f are intentionally weird because they are unlikely to collide with other names passed through ... to .f.

---
## More maps

Other types of map that return specific things

* `map` - list
* `map_lgl` logical
* `map_int` integer
* `map_dbl` double
* `map_chr` character
* `map_df` dataframe

Maps are "type-safe" they will fail if they cannot return the correct data type (unlike apply)

```
## Error: Can't coerce element 1 from a double to a logical
```
