## The relationship between Physical Activity and Reaction times

In the figure we have asked students to complete the Human Benchmark reaction times test three times - and self-report this alongside their own estimate of average daily physical activity: 

- Is there any apparent relationship between self-reported activity and reaction speed?

- Are there any flaws or caveats to the trust we have in this data?

- Any other observations?

## The relationship between "Handedness" and Reaction times

In the figure we have asked students to complete the Human Benchmark reaction times test three times - and self-report this alongside which hand they consider dominant: 


```{r figure two, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, out.width = "120%"}

run_plot("Hand")

```
